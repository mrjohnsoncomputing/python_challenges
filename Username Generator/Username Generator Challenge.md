# Username Generator Challenge
At MrJohnsonComputing Inc. HQ, each member of staff is given a unique username.

The username is made of three elements:
* The first letter of the person's first name
* The first four letters of the person's surname
* The last two digits of the person's birth year.

For example, Derek Jones, born in 1971, would be given the username DJone71
