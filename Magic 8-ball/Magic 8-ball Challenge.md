# Magic 8-ball Challenge
A magic 8-ball is a large version of the black ball from pool. 
The idea is that you ask it a question and then shake the ball.
When you shake a magic 8-ball, a little dice with a different response on each side flips around and comes to rest, giving you a random answer to your question. 

Your program will ask the user for a question, and then give them a random response.

## Extension
### 1
Your program will ask the user if they want to continue. If yes, they can ask another question. If no, the program says goodbye and exits.

### 2
Before asking their question, the user picks the theme of their magic 8-ball.
An example theme might be robot, where the random responses are given as if a robot was saying them.
e.g.
```
>>Bleep bloop, that is a negative
>>My sensors detect an 80% chance of success
```
The user should be able to stop asking questions, and return to the theme menu.
They should then from there be able to pick a mew theme or exot the program.
### 3
The user's question and the random response should be written to a text file, so that it is saved after the program is closed.
